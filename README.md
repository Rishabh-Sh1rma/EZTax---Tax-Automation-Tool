## 📌 Why EZTax?

> 💡 *“Nearly 90% of Indian individuals struggle with tax filing. EZTax bridges that gap with automation, education, and personalization.”*

Traditional tools offer static calculations. EZTax dynamically adapts to the user's profile and helps them **understand** taxation laws like 80C, HRA, 80D, and exemptions based on location and age.
